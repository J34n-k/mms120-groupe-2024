            Dating in person in the Philippines involves lots of nuances which stems from the old traditional dating cultures, particularly the custom of ligaw or courtship. Unlike in Western cultures, where the direct question “Will you be my girlfriend?” is common, in the Philippines, the process begins with the more formal and respectful “Can I court you?” This question signifies the suitor’s intention to prove himself worthy of the woman’s affection while respecting her autonomy in the decision.</p>

            <li>
                <h4>Societal Pressure and expectations</h4>
                <p>Traditional dating involves a lot of factors, including pressures, expectations, and influences from family and the community. There are pressures to conform to societal expectations, such as dating for marriage, gender roles, and certain rituals and norms.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Limited Opportunities</h4>
                <p>People are restricted when it comes to traditional dating, as it relies on personal connections, chance encounters, and social groups such as school, the workplace, or neighborhood, which limits options and exposure to diverse people and backgrounds.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Time-consuming</h4>
                <p>Going on in-person dates, setting up dates, and attending various social events with the hopes of meeting someone new can take up a lot of time. Relationships also develop more slowly in traditional dating because of cultural norms, such as gradual courtship.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="horizontal-list">
            <li>
                <h4>Financially Consuming</h4>
                <p>Traditional in-person dating can be financially consuming, especially when going on multiple dates with the hopes of finding the right person. Dinner at a restaurant, transportation, entertainment, and gifts can become overwhelming. In traditional dating, there are unequal financial expectations due to gender roles and norms that expect that one partner, traditionally the man, to pay for most or all expenses.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Limited Access to Information</h4>
                <p>Compared to modern dating, which uses dating apps that include profiles and backgrounds, traditional dating is a blank slate in which the initial impressions may be based on physical appearance or the interactions themselves when they meet face-to-face. </p>

                    <p>Online dating apps once began as a digital way for users to express and share their interests with the intention of finding a significant other. The oldest known digital method for dating, long before the spread of the Internet, was created by two Stanford alumnus, Jim Harvey and Phil Fialer, called the Happy Families Planning Service. They gave questionnaires to 49 students, and put them through Stanford’s IBM 650 computer, running an algorithm that would pair their participants with each other using their questionnaire answers. While the resulting matches did not create long-term relationships, this was just the beginning for digital dating.

            <p class="centered-paragraph">
                Moving past many other digital dating methods, sharing email addresses and joining online dating forums were all you needed to look for love online. While slower and inefficient compared to the modern version of online dating, these grassroot methods gave a more honest and in-depth experience between soon-to-be partners. As the Internet grew, online dating websites also took form, many of which would help people find their significant other overseas or across states.
            </p>
                <p class="centered-paragraph"> 
                However with the launch of Tinder in 2012, the online dating industry found its new tool to get users and business running with their swiping mechanism. Jonathan Badeen introduced the swiping mechanism to college students, their initial test demographic, incentivizing users to use the app by “gamifying” the dating process. Bumble followed the same formula, hoping to cater to a more feminist audience, and Grindr, an LGBTQ+ dating app predating Tinder, also applied the swiping mechanism.

        <div class="text-content">
            <p>
            Dating apps have altered traditional methods of meeting love partners by reducing the reliance on social media for matching. Traditionally, individuals might meet possible partners through common friends, family gatherings, or social gatherings. However, sites such as Tinder and Bumble allow users to interact with a far larger pool of potential companions outside of their social groups. According to Smith (2023), this shift allows people to pursue relationships with people they may never meet in their daily lives, leading to a more diversified dating pool. Despite these benefits, the effectiveness of online dating has been challenged for encouraging shallow relationships. Many users indicate that relationships built through apps are less deep and stable than those formed through traditional channels (Johnson, 2022).

    <h2 class="heading-intro">IMPACT ON INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOR</h2>
        <p class="centered-paragraph"> 
        Individuals' dating behaviors have also changed as a result of the influence of online dating platforms. According to Lee (2024), the anonymity and distance provided by these platforms might lead to "online disinhibition," in which users feel more free to express themselves in ways they might not in face-to-face conversations. While this might help with initial relationships, it can also lead to misrepresentation and unreasonable expectations, as individuals frequently design their online identities to attract more matches. Further, research shows that the growing use of dating apps can have a negative impact on mental health, causing anxiety and low self-esteem when interactions do not fulfill expectations (Davis, 2023). The quick pace at which relationships form online frequently accelerates physical intimacy while postponing emotional connection, changing how people approach romantic relationships.

            <p>
            Dating apps have democratized the dating experience by making it more available to a wider range of people. According to Thompson (2022), they cater to a wide range of demographics, allowing users of varied origins, ages, and orientations to meet mates who share their interests. This accessibility lowers the barriers that traditionally excluded groups may experience in making romantic connections. In addition, online platforms frequently include features that allow users to filter possible matches based on specific criteria such as interests, values, and relationship goals (Roberts & Kim, 2023). This level of personalization contrasts strongly with traditional dating strategies, which rely mainly on accidental encounters or societal approbation. As a result, many people now consider internet dating a legitimate and productive way to find mates, leading to a cultural shift that normalizes looking for love online.

            Online dating has allowed individuals to efficiently reach out to their potential partners due to technological advancements. However, it has gained a negative connotation for promoting superficial relationships and unreliable connections. According to Sharabi & Dorrance-Hall (2024), the tendency known as the ‘online dating effect’ results from online daters reporting fewer stable and fulfilling marriages compared to those who engage in traditional dating. Moreover, online dating apps profit from their users, focusing more on adding features that prompt users to curate their identities and pay for exclusive access to additional features, thereby increasing their exposure to more potential partners (French, 2022).

    <h2 class="heading-intro">THE IMPACT OF ONLINE DATING ON RELATIONSHIPS AND SOCIAL NORMS</h2>
        <p class="centered-paragraph"> 
        In addition to disrupting conventional methods of finding love, the rise of online dating coincides with a shift in attitudes and practices surrounding relationships and marriage, with more people putting off marriage or opting to stay single (Anderson et al., 2022). Furthermore, online dating has altered the pace at which individuals get to know each other, as connections formed online typically develop into sexual partnerships much more quickly than in traditional relationships (Ferguson, 2022). On the contrary, online dating offers individuals a more private space to interact with potential partners, often away from the social sphere, which contrasts with the public nature of traditional dating practices.

    <h2 class="heading-intro">THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN ACCESSIBILITY AND AUTHENTICITY IN ONLINE DATING</h2>
        <p class="centered-paragraph"> 
        Likewise, online dating opens up a wider range of potential relationships, as users can set their preferences and location on these apps, allowing them to connect with more people who align with their interests. However, it can be harder to truly get to know others through a screen, as what is seen online often represents a curated version of themselves (Dunlop, 2018). In contrast, traditional dating typically involves forming relationships through acquaintances and face-to-face interactions, providing individuals with the opportunity to assess each other personally and gauge their intentions more clearly, in contrast to the digital realm of online dating.

              The innovation of online dating apps like Tinder and Bumble shows a

              <strong>reshaping individuals’ romantic connections.</strong> With
              the disruptive technology, we can see that applications like these
              are much more convenient for
              <strong>accessibility and efficiency </strong> for finding your
              potential love. But having its advantages has its challenges as

              <p>In the Philippine traditional dating, it is part of our
